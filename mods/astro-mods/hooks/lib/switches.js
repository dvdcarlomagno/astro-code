// The switches, as `ac` last said them this session -- and nothing else (ADR-071 rule c).
//
// This module reads no file and writes none. The only state the plugin has is the in-memory
// map below, filled by asking `ac` once at session.start (and again on every /reload-plugins,
// which fires session.start again). So a switch flipped with `ac mods enable|disable` is
// what the plugin sees on the next session.start, with no second copy to drift. `ac` is the
// only writer of the switches and the only reader of ~/.astro/config.json.
//
// `--switches-only` is the cheap read: it never spawns `claude`, so asking costs one `ac`
// start. The 5 s timeout stays under the bundled typings' session.start hook budget; an `ac`
// that is missing, slow or broken makes the call or setSwitches THROW, and the engine's
// `.catch` (failopen.js) turns that into a pass-through plus one notice -- with every switch off.
//
// The `$.process.run` call itself is spelled in register.js: the plugin validator follows `$`
// only into functions declared in the same file, never across an import, so this module takes
// the RESULT of the call and stays free of `$`.
